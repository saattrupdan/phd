# PhD Thesis

This is my PhD thesis from 2020, entitled "Virtual Set Theory - Taking the Blue Pill" 
and advised by Professor Philip Welch at the University of Bristol.

A PDF of the final version, including corrections from the examiners, can be
found in `misc/PGR_submission_nielsen_dan_1638518_with_corrections.pdf`

Everything in `chapters/part2` was the result of a research visit at Professor
Grigor Sargsyan at the University of Rutgers in February 2019, and is joint
work with Stefan Mesken. All of this was *not* included in the thesis, and anyone 
who is willing to continue on this work are free to do so, as long as both
Stefan and I will be accredited as well.

To see a brief introduction to what the content in `chapters/part2` is about,
