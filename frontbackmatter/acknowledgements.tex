  \section*{\huge Acknowledgements}
  I want to thank my supervisor Philip Welch, both for offering valuable insights and guidance throughout this set theoretic journey, as well as for all the wonderful chats we have had over the years. Philip is the existence proof of it being possible for a professor to both be a brilliant academic as well as a wonderful human being.

  I would also like to thank all my lovely postgraduate friends at the University of Bristol and abroad, who have made these past few years a great experience. Doing a PhD can be a lonely affair, so having such a network of like-minded friends to hang out with is invaluable.

  Lastly, I would like to thank Amy, who transformed the last phase of my PhD from being incredibly stressful, due to both the thesis as well as the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, to being truly enjoyable.
