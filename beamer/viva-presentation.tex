  Many large cardinals are defined as the \alert{critical point} of an elementary embedding from the universe $V$ into a transitive $\N$.

  We can weaken this large cardinal definition to merely requiring the elementary embedding and target model to exist in a \alert<1>{generic extension} (of $V$).

  The \alert<1>{virtual} large cardinals are faint large cardinals where the target model is a subset of $V$.

  In our definitions of virtually $\theta$-strongs and $\theta$-supercompacts, we require that $\pi(\kappa)>\theta$.

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other?}

  Most of the results in this section are comprised in a paper joint with \alert{Dimopoulos} and \alert{Gitman}, and will be submitted within a couple of weeks or so.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Strongs and supercompacts}}

  Virtuals behave differently from their real counterparts. The following result from Gitman and Schindler (2018) gave an example of such surprising differences:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Gitman-Schindler)}
    The following are equivalent for an uncountable cardinal $\kappa$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\kappa$ is virtually supercompact;
      \item $\kappa$ is virtually strong.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Strongs and supercompacts}}

  We showed that, in $L$, virtually measurables are either virtually $\omega$-superstrong or virtually strong. This gives the following consistency result:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    The following are equiconsistent for uncountable $\theta$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The existence of a virtually $\theta$-strong cardinal;
      \item The existence of a virtually $\theta$-measurable cardinal.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  \only<2>{The reason why we are working in $L$ is that, in $L$, being virtually measurable is equivalent to being virtually prestrong. This can be seen by condensation.}

  \only<3>{Together with the Gitman-Schindler result we thus get that the virtually measurables are equiconsistent with the virtually supercompacts.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Strongs and supercompacts}}

  Our intuition about the prestrongs having to do with the Kunen inconsistency is confirmed by the following result.

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item There exists an uncountable cardinal $\theta$ and a virtually $\theta$-prestrong cardinal which is not virtually $\theta$-strong;
      \item There exists a \alert<2>{virtually rank-into-rank cardinal}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  \visible<2->{$\kappa$ is \alert<2>{virtually rank-into-rank} if it is the critical point of a generic embedding $\pi\colon H_\theta^V\to H_\theta^V$.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Woodins and Vopenkas}}

  Moving to the Woodins and Vopenkas, these also \textit{almost} form a ``virtual pair'':

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Dimopoulos-Gitman-N.)}
    The following are equivalent for an inaccessible $\kappa$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\kappa$ is Vopenka;
      \item $\kappa$ is virtually pre-Woodin;
      \item $\kappa$ is faintly pre-Woodin.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Woodins, Vopenkas and Berkeleys}}

  As for the distinction between the virtually pre-Woodins and virtually Woodins, we begin from another angle. 

  \visible<2->{Letting $\textsf{gVP}$ be the generic analogue of Vopenkas Principle, Gitman and Hamkins (2019) showed the following:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Gitman-Hamkins)}
    If $0^\sharp$ exists then $\textsf{gVP}$ holds and $\textsf{On}$ is not Mahlo.
  \end{block}}

  \visible<3->{In sharpening the hypothesis, we arrived at the virtual analogue of the \alert<3>{Berkeley cardinals}. 

  \begin{block}{Definition}
    A cardinal $\delta$ is \alert{virtually Berkeley} if to every transitive set $\M$ with $\delta\subseteq\M$, there is a generic elementary $\pi\colon\M\to\M$ with $\text{crit}(\pi)<\delta$, and $\text{crit}(\pi)$ can be chosen arbitrarily large below $\delta$.
  \end{block}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Woodins, Vopenkas and Berkeleys}}

  Gitman and Hamkin's result was then firstly sharpened to these Berkeleys:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    If there exists a virtually Berkeley cardinal then $\textsf{gVP}$ holds and $\textsf{On}$ is not Mahlo.
  \end{block}

  \visible<2->{But in analysing the other direction, an interesting result fell out:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    If there are no virtually Berkeley cardinals then $\textsf{On}$ is virtually pre-Woodin iff $\textsf{On}$ is virtually Woodin.
  \end{block}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do the virtuals interact with each other? \\
              {\small Woodins, Vopenkas and Berkeleys}}

  Ultimately this led to the following equivalence, showing Berkeley cardinals to be the optimal hypothesis, as well as showing that the Berkeley cardinals are the \alert<1>{natural analogues} of the virtually rank-into-rank cardinals:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    The following are equivalent: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\textsf{gVP}$ implies that $\textsf{On}$ is Mahlo;
      \item $\textsf{On}$ is virtually pre-Woodin iff $\textsf{On}$ is virtually Woodin;
      \item There are no virtually Berkeley cardinals.
    \end{enumerate}

  The results in this section are joint with \alert{Schlicht} and will most likely appear in a joint paper of ours.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How indestructible are the virtuals?}

  We have seen that the virtuals behave differently from their real counterparts, so we can start asking \textit{how} different. 

  \visible<2->{Indestructibility properties of small large cardinals have been widely studied\footnote<2->{\scriptsize Authors include Apter, Cheng, Cody, Cox, Fuchs, Gitman, Hamkins and Johnstone.}, so it would be interesting if we could find a virtual analogue of Laver indestructibility.}

  \visible<3->{After many failed attempts, we strengthened our assumption.

  \begin{block}{Definition (N.-Schlicht)}
    $\kappa$ is \alert<3>{generically setwise $\theta$-supercompact} if it is faintly $\theta$-supercompact, but where the target model is closed under ${<}\theta$-sequences \textit{in the generic extension}.
  \end{block}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How indestructible are the virtuals?}

  We showed that these exhibit many indestructibility properties:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.-Schlicht)}
    Generically setwise supercompact cardinals $\kappa$ are indestructible by:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Small forcings;
      \item Adding $\kappa$ many Cohen reals;
      \item ${<}\kappa$-directed closed forcings.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  Note that we do \alert{not} require any preparatory forcing.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How indestructible are the virtuals?}

  This is all great, but we feared that the strengthened concept was \textit{too} strong. 

  \visible<2->{We noted firstly that Woodin's countable stationary tower forcing provides an upper consistency bound at a proper class of Woodins, so we at least do not reach the supercompacts.} 

  \visible<3->{Usuba then showed the incredibly surprising result that we are in fact still in the consistency realm among the virtuals:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Usuba)}
    If $\kappa$ is virtually extendible then $\text{Col}(\omega,{<}\kappa)$ forces that $\omega_1$ is generically setwise supercompact.
  \end{block}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How indestructible are the virtuals?}

  Despite their weak consistency strength, these cardinals seem to be quite unnatural:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.-Schlicht)}
    No cardinal is generically setwise supercompact in either $L$, $K$ below a measurable, or $L[\mu]$ with $\mu$ being a normal ultrafilter.
  \end{block}

  }

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Infinite games \\ {\small The countable case}}

  The countable case is when we start making connections back to the virtual large cardinals:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.-Schindler)}
    In $L$, the following are equivalent for a cardinal $\kappa$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\kappa$ is strategic $\omega$-Ramsey;
      \item $\kappa$ is virtually measurable.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Infinite games \\ {\small The countable case}}

  Together with our previous consistency results, we also get the following:

  \begin{block}{Corollary (N.-Schindler)}
    The following are equiconsistent:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The existence of a strategic $\omega$-Ramsey cardinal;
      \item The existence of a virtually strong cardinal.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Infinite games \\ {\small The countable case}}

  As we exceed $\omega$, we make a large jump in consistency strength:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    The following are equiconsistent:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The existence of a strategic $(\omega+1)$-Ramsey cardinal;
      \item The existence of a measurable cardinal.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \visible<2->{The proof shows that there is an embedding $\pi\colon V\to\N$ in a $\text{Col}(\omega,2^\kappa)$-extension of $V$, from which there is a measurable cardinal in an inner model of that extension.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Infinite games \\ {\small The uncountable case}}

  Welch and Schindler also showed that at the uncountable stage, the strategic Ramseys become measurable in $K$:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Welch)}
    If $0^\P$ does not exist then every strategic $\omega_1$-Ramsey cardinal is measurable in $K$.

    A poset property $\Phi(\kappa)$ is \alert<3>{ideal-absolute} if whenever there is a $\Phi(\kappa)$ forcing extension $V[g]$ containing a generic $V$-measure on $\kappa$, then there is an ideal $I\in V$ on $\kappa$ such that $\mathcal P(\kappa)/I$ is forcing equivalent to a forcing satisfying $\Phi(\kappa)$.

  We first note that a few standard forcing properties are ideal absolute:

  \begin{block}{Proposition (Folklore)}
    ``$\kappa^+$-chain condition'' is ideal-absolute.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Theorem (N.)}
    ``${<}\lambda$-distributivity'' is ideal-absolute for regular $\lambda\in[\omega,\kappa^+]$.
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

  The main result of the section is then the following, which builds upon and improves an unpublished result due to Foreman:

  \begin{block}{Theorem (Foreman-N.)}
    Let $\kappa$ and $\lambda\leq\kappa^+$ be regular cardinals. If player II has a winning strategy in \alert<2>{$\G_\lambda^-(\kappa)$} then $\kappa$ carries a $\kappa$-complete normal ideal $I$ such that $\mathcal P(\kappa)/I$ is $(\kappa,\kappa)$-distributive and has a dense ${<}\lambda$-closed subset.
  \end{block}

  \visible<2->{
  Here \alert<2>{$\G_\lambda^-(\kappa)$} is the same game as $\G_\lambda^\theta(\kappa)$ for any $\theta$, but where we do not require the final measure to have a wellfounded ultrapower.
  }

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ideals}

  Using our previous game-theoretic results, we get the following two corollaries.

  \begin{block}{Corollary (N.)}
    ``$(\kappa,\kappa)$-distributive ${<}\lambda$-closed'' is ideal-absolute for regular $\lambda\in[\omega,\kappa^+]$.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Corollary (N.)}
    ``${<}\lambda$-closed $\lambda$-sized'' is ideal-absolute for regular $\lambda\in[\omega,\kappa]$ such that $2^{<\theta}<\kappa$ for every $\theta<\lambda$.
  \end{block}
