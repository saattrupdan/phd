# Comments to David Aspero's corrections

1. The end of the proof of Proposition 1.10 is marked with a little red triangle. What does this mean? Does he want more detail?
2. In Lemma 1.49, David comments that I do not need to say that the embeddings in (i) and (ii) exists. But this is not automatic, as the branches could have drops.
3. In Definition 2.13, David mentions that I need to specify in which model I am requiring closure under sequences. But I specifically take an intersection with V, so it can only be V-sequences?
4. I have changed Definition 2.25 to talk about homomorphisms in V in (i), which is what Lemma 2.24 talks about with gVP as well. This fixes the mistake in Proposition 2.26.
5. In the comment after Definition 4.4, David asks if it is 'ideally measurable' instead of 'generically measurable'. But here I *do* mean what I wrote, where "these definitions" are referring to both Phi(kappa) generically measurables as well as Phi(kappa) ideally measurables.
6. For David's comment to Question 5.2(ii), I don't see why it couldn't make sense for all theta, by an inductive argument somehow?
